# GhosTCP
GhosTCP is a program for Windows that protects the TCP connections from being interfered.  

## Run as Client
run tcpioneer.exe to start the program
## Run as Service
run install.bat to install the service

## How to configure
```
  server=IP:Port    #domain in config will use this DNS(DNSoverTCP),if not set it will use the DNS of system
  ipv6=true/false   #domain below will enable/disable IPv6
  subdomain=*       #set the depth of domain search, default 2
  ttl=*             #the fake tcp packet will use this TTL
  domain=ip,ip,...  #this domain will use these IPs
  domain            #this domain will be resolved by DNS
  ip:port           #this ip:port will send fake packet when creating connection
  method=*          #the methods to modify TCP
  ```
## methods:
```
  ttl               #the fake tcp packets will use the TTL you set
  w-md5             #the fake tcp packets will have a wrong md5 option
  w-csum            #the fake tcp packets will have a wrong checksum
  w-ack             #the fake tcp packets will have a wrong ACK number
  tfo               #SYN packet will take a part of data when the server supports TCP Fast Open
  
  df                #the true tcp packets will not be fragmented
  https             #the domain below will be move to https when using http on port 80
```
## How to get the TTL
```
tracert 8.8.8.8
```
set the ttl **longer** than the TTL to the node whose IP address is in your area and **shorter** than the TTL to the server.

## Which DNS server should I use
```
nslookup -vc t.co {dns-server}
```
this command can test whether the server supports Dns over **Tcp**.
